                    <h2 class="textos">As main rapper and leader of BTS, Kim Namjoon -- also known as RM -- topped charts and broke records across the globe with the K-pop powerhouse boy band, while also launching a successful solo career in 2015 with debut mixtape RM. He followed in 2018 with Mono, an international Top 30 hit. In addition to his own hip-hop-influenced material, he collaborated with many top artists .
                    <p style="margin-top:20px"> Born in Ilsan, South Korea, the Seoul-based artist developed a love of hip-hop at a young age (influenced by Korean rap outfit ) and honed his English skills by viewing the American television show Friends. He started performing as Runch Randa and collaborated with fellow Korean rapper Zico. It wasn't until 2010, during auditions with BigHit, that Kim Namjoon was recruited as the first member of BTS. Soon joined by Suga, J-Hope, Jin, Jimin, Jungkook, and V, Kim Namjoon and his BTS' bandmates quickly ascended to the top of the K-pop ranks, breaking chart records in the U.S. -- where they became the first Asian act to top the Billboard 200 with 2018's Love Yourself: Tear -- and selling out world tours. On the side, Kim branched out with his own solo material, debuting in 2015 with the self-titled mixtape RM, which peaked at number 12 on the U.S. World Albums chart. Three years later, just months after BTS scored their first number one on the Billboard 200, he issued his sophomore solo effort, Mono, which bested his previous effort with a strong number two showing on the World Albums chart. A record-breaking run with BTS followed with the Map of the Soul era, carrying Kim and the band into the 2020s. In 2021, during that year's BTS Festa, he released the solo track "Bicycle."</p>

                    <h2 class="textos">South Korean singer, songwriter, and producer Jungkook is best known as a member and main vocalist of K-pop boy band BTS. Debuting with the group in 2013, he went on to earn global success alongside his bandmates, selling out stadiums around the world and topping the charts in multiple markets. In addition to his activities with BTS, he's not only appeared on various television reality shows but also recorded and produced his own solo material such as 2020's "Still with You."
                    <p style="margin-top:20px">Jeon Jungkook was born in 1997 in Busan. Inspired by K-pop predecessor G-Dragon of Big Bang (as well as American artists like Justin Timberlake and Usher), he decided to pursue a career in music, beginning his training in the early 2010s with BigHit. After honing his dancing skills at home and in Los Angeles, he was recruited as a founding member of BigHit's newest boy band, BTS. They issued their first effort, 2 Cool 4 Skool, in 2013 and soon found themselves at the top of the K-pop world with international chart-toppers such as Love Yourself: Tear and Map of the Soul: 7. Within the group, Jungkook got to showcase his talents with spotlight moments such as "Begin" from Wings and "Euphoria" from Love Yourself: Answer. He also helped produce the BTS tracks "Love Is Not Over" and "Magic Shop."</p>
                    <p style="margin-top:20px">Outside of the group, he joined other Korean artists for the 2015 "One Dream, One Korea" project and issued the track "Still with You" in June 2020. The following year, Jungkook teamed with Iyori Shimizu and UTA for the single "Film Out," which promoted BTS' 2021 Japanese album: BTS, The Best.</p>
